Aprender a ver todos los elementos con el scroll para tratar de lograr lo mismo pero haciendo click en un botón o haciendo drag an move con el mouse.

<h2 style="color:#62f1aa;">Notes</h2>

* The <b style="color:magenta;">overflow</b> property specifies whether to clip the content or to add scrollbars when the content of an element is too big to fit in the specified area.

    It has the following values:

    * **visible** - Default. The overflow is not clipped. The content renders outside the element's box
    * **hidden** - The overflow is clipped, and the rest of the content will be invisible
    * **scroll** - The overflow is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest of the content
    * **auto** - Similar to scroll, but it adds scrollbars only when necessary

* The <b style="color:magenta;">flex-shrink</b> property specifies how the item will shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container.
    * default value is _1_

* The <b style="color:yellow;">mouseleave</b> event is fired at an Element when the cursor of a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved out of it.

  **mouseleave** and **mouseout** are similar but differ in that mouseleave does not bubble (no genera burbujas) and mouseout does (y mouseout sí). This means that mouseleave is fired when the pointer has exited the element and all of its descendants, whereas mouseout is fired when the pointer leaves the element or leaves one of the element's descendants (even if the pointer is still within the element).
